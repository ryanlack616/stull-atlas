                <p>Jan, this page is a thank you. For your work, for what you've taught, for the people you've worked alongside. These questions came out of the research for this site &mdash; from reading John Glick's articles, from old magazine features, from conversations with the people who know you. We're asking because the answers matter, and because nobody else has written them down yet.</p>

                    <li>What was it about Landino's teaching style that was so transformative? What made his class different?</li>
                    <li>Landino came from a family of 18 and taught for 42 years. Did you know about his personal background? What was he like as a person, not just a teacher?</li>

                    <li>John Glick wrote about you by name in <em>The Studio Potter</em> (Winter 1973&ndash;74): "Jan Sadowski came as a high school student, very advanced in potting, with a lot of personal ambition." Did you know he wrote that? Do you have a copy of the article?</li>
                    <li>What was your role at Plum Tree in those first days? What did Glick have you doing?</li>
                    <li>Glick evolved his terminology for studio helpers from "apprentices" to "assistants" to "residents." What did he call you? How did he refer to your role?</li>
                    <li>You worked alongside Glick for four years. What were the most important things he taught you &mdash; technically and philosophically?</li>
                    <li>Were you doing your own work at Plum Tree, or exclusively assisting Glick?</li>
                    <li>How did working at Plum Tree influence your own aesthetic? Your silver-copper platters with carved linear decoration &mdash; does any of that trace back to Glick's influence?</li>
                    <li>Glick's Cranbrook teacher was Maija Grotell, the "Mother of American Ceramics." She didn't retire until 1966 and lived in Pontiac until 1973. Did you ever meet her? Did Glick ever take you to Cranbrook?</li>
                    <li>There were other apprentices and assistants at Plum Tree over the decades. Did you know any of them? Did you stay in touch with Glick's later studio helpers?</li>
                    <li>Brett Gray was John Glick's last resident (2010&ndash;2011). Did you know about that? Were you aware of how the program evolved after you?</li>
                    <li>Glick also wrote "The Evolution of Mentorship" in 2008 and "Towards Humanism in Apprenticeship" in 1981. Were you consulted for either? Did he ever interview you about the early days?</li>

                    <li>You were head of the ceramics department for more than 20 years. How did the program change during your tenure?</li>

                    <li>He said there were boxes of ceramics everywhere and you could buy them for $20 a box. Can you describe what was up there? How many pieces did you acquire?</li>
                    <li>You got some 1950s-era pieces including ceramic matchbooks. Do you still have them? What else was in those boxes?</li>
                    <li>How did you get the opportunity to be there? Who let you in? Did others know about this?</li>

                    <li>He said you could sell "a whole truck" of ceramics at the Art Fair. What was the peak era for sales? How much could you expect to bring in?</li>
                    <li>The Ann Arbor fair started as Esther Rainville's idea during Bargain Days in 1960. Did you know her? Was there an old guard of potters at the fair?</li>
                    <li>Were you part of any potters' guilds or co-ops? The Potters Guild was involved with the Ann Arbor fair from the very beginning.</li>

                    <li>You also teach at OCC in Royal Oak &mdash; the program Blosser founded. What's it like to teach in the program he built?</li>
