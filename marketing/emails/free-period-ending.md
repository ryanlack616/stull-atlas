Hi {{first_name}},

Just a heads-up: the Stull Atlas free access window ends on **April 30**.

**Here's what you'll keep on Free (forever):**
- 2D Stull Chart Explorer
- UMF Calculator
- Materials Browser
- Interactive Guide

**Here's what goes behind the paywall:**
- Blend calculators (triaxial, biaxial, radial, line, etc.)
- Glaze Optimizer & AI Suggestions
- 3D Explorer, Compare Panel, Similarity Search
- Import/Export & saved recipes
- Analysis tools (clustering, density, voids)

If Stull Atlas has been useful in your studio, you can lock in access:

- **Solo** — $8/mo (line blends, save recipes, import/export)
- **Pro** — $18/mo (everything)

No pressure — Free is fully functional for exploring and calculating.
