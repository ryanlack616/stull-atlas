Hi {{first_name}},

Just a heads-up: your Stull Atlas Pro trial ends on **{{trial_end_date}}**.

**Here's what you'll keep on Free:**
- 2D Stull Chart Explorer
- UMF Calculator
- Materials Browser
- Interactive Guide

**Here's what you'll lose:**
- Blend calculators (triaxial, biaxial, radial, etc.)
- Glaze Optimizer & AI Suggestions
- 3D Explorer, Compare Panel, Similarity Search
- Import/Export & saved recipes

If Pro has been useful, you can lock in your access:

- **Solo** — $8/mo (line blends, save recipes, import/export)
- **Pro** — $18/mo (everything)

[Upgrade now →](https://stullatlas.app/#/pricing)

No pressure — Free is still fully functional for exploring and calculating.
