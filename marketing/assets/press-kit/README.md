**About Stull Atlas**
Stull Atlas is a web-based glaze chemistry tool that helps ceramic artists visualize, compare, and design glaze recipes using Unity Molecular Formula (UMF) analysis. Built on the Stull chart framework — first published by R.T. Stull in 1912 — the platform brings century-old ceramic science into a modern, interactive interface. Features include 2D/3D data exploration over 10,000+ community glazes, blend calculators, AI-powered suggestions, and experimental design tools. Stull Atlas is available at rlv.lol/stullv2.
