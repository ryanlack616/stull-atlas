# Stull Atlas — Taglines & Value Propositions

## Primary Tagline
**"Navigate the chemistry of ceramics."**

## Alternate Taglines
- "From recipe to result — understand your glazes."
- "The periodic table for potters."
- "See what your glaze is actually doing."
- "Chemistry made visual. Glazes made predictable."

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
Stull Atlas is a web-based tool that helps ceramic artists understand, compare, and design glaze recipes using Unity Molecular Formula (UMF) analysis. Visualize thousands of glazes on interactive Stull charts, find similar recipes, blend new formulas, and optimize compositions — all without a chemistry degree.

## Value Propositions by Audience

### Studio Potter
"Stop guessing. See exactly where your glaze sits in the Stull chart, find proven recipes nearby, and calculate blends to get where you want to go."

### Glaze Technician / Production
"Optimize batch consistency with UMF analysis, surface fitting, and space-filling experimental designs. Replace trial-and-error with data."

### Educator
"Teach glaze chemistry visually. Classroom accounts let students explore the Stull chart, compare historical glazes, and design experiments — together."

### Student
"Free tier gives you the Stull chart explorer and UMF calculator. Pro unlocks blends, optimization, and the AI suggestion engine when you're ready."

## Key Differentiators
1. **Visual-first** — Interactive 2D/3D Stull charts, not spreadsheets
2. **10,000+ real glazes** — Glazy community dataset, pre-analyzed
3. **Blend calculators** — Line, triaxial, biaxial, radial, quadaxial, space-filling
4. **AI suggestions** — Describe what you want in plain English
5. **Offline-capable** — Works without internet after first load
6. **Privacy-respecting** — Your recipes stay yours; no tracking
