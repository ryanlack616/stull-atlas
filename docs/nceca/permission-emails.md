These need your voice, Ryan — edit freely. The key info is right, the tone should be yours.

## 1. Tony Hansen — Digitalfire

**To:** tony@digitalfire.com
**Subject:** Stull Atlas — using Digitalfire material data & linking to your site

---

Hi Tony,

I'm Ryan Lack — I built Stull Atlas (stullatlas.app), an interactive glaze chemistry explorer. I'm a potter and software engineer in Howell, Michigan, and I'll be at NCECA 2026 in Pittsburgh.

Stull Atlas uses Digitalfire material data in a few ways I want you to know about:

- **Material database** — I've integrated material names, oxide analyses, and descriptions from Digitalfire as a reference for potters using the UMF calculator and blend tools
- **OxideLink** — Clickable oxide labels throughout the app link directly to the relevant Digitalfire page, driving traffic to your site
- **Full-text search** — The OmniSearch feature indexes Digitalfire material descriptions so potters can discover materials by properties

I want to be transparent about this. Your work is the most comprehensive ceramic materials reference that exists, and I've been using it as a potter for years before I started building software for potters.

I'm not reproducing your articles or analysis content — the integration is focused on material specs (oxide analyses, alternate names) and linking back to digitalfire.com for the full picture. Every OxideLink click goes to your site.

A few questions:
1. Are you comfortable with this usage? I'll adjust anything that doesn't work for you.
2. Would you like a "Data powered by Digitalfire" attribution with a link on the materials page?
3. Are you going to NCECA? I'd love to meet in person and show you the app.

The app is free to explore at stullatlas.app — no account needed. I'd genuinely appreciate your feedback on how it handles your material data.

Thanks,

## 2. Derek Philipau — Glazy

**To:** derek@glazy.org (or via Glazy contact form / GitHub)
**Subject:** Stull Atlas — built on Glazy data, heading to NCECA

Hi Derek,

I'm Ryan Lack — I built Stull Atlas (stullatlas.app), an interactive glaze chemistry explorer built on top of the Glazy open dataset. I'm a potter and software engineer in Howell, Michigan.

Your public CSV export is the backbone of the app — 9,000+ glazes plotted on interactive Stull charts with UMF fingerprinting, blend tools, and comparison mode. The data is used under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, and Glazy is attributed throughout the app.

I wanted to reach out directly because:
1. I'm presenting at NCECA 2026 in Pittsburgh (Resource Hall) and want to make sure my attribution of Glazy is right and visible
2. Your vue-plotly-umf-charts and ceramic-chemistry-visualization repos were direct inspirations for the visualization approach
3. I think there might be opportunities to contribute back — I've built some tooling (molar weight sensitivity analysis, variability visualization) that could be useful to the Glazy community

A few things I'd like your input on:
- Is the current Glazy attribution adequate, or would you prefer specific wording?
- Any concerns about how the data is being used?
- Would you want to see the app before NCECA? Happy to give you a walkthrough.

The explorer is live at stullatlas.app — free, no account needed.

Thanks for building Glazy. It changed how I think about glazes, and I'm trying to build something that does the same for other potters.

## Notes

- **Digitalfire** — proprietary data, permission genuinely needed. Tony's active and reachable via digitalfire.com contact.
- **Glazy** — CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 so legally you're covered, but the courtesy email builds a relationship. Derek is a software developer himself (check his GitHub) and would likely appreciate the heads-up.
- **Orton** — If you're using Orton cone charts or data, those are trademarked. Check if any Orton-specific graphics/data are in the app beyond standard cone number references (which are generic industry terms). Standard cone numbers (04, 6, 10, etc.) don't need permission — they're industry standard like Fahrenheit.
