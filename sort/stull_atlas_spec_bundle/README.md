# Stull Atlas — Spec Bundle

This ZIP contains the consolidated specification for **Stull Atlas** (program ideal, modes, navigation, build contracts),
plus implementation-oriented notes (engine/event contract, skins system, and DOS overlay spec).

**Source of truth rule:** The canonical spec is `SPEC.md`. Update that first going forward.
