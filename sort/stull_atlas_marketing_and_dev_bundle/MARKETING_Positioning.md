# Positioning & Messaging

## One-liner
**Stull Atlas** is a glaze calculation and Stull-map exploration tool that feels like lab equipment: fast, transparent, and built for learning and repeatable results.

## Short pitch (2–3 sentences)
Stull Atlas helps you calculate, validate, and explore glaze chemistry with a map-first workflow that makes “what to change next” obvious. It pairs a friendly Basic mode for quick work with an Advanced mode for beautiful data, comparisons, blends, and checks—all powered by one deterministic calculation engine.

## Who it’s for
- Studio potters and ceramic artists who want dependable calculations and faster iteration
- Educators and students learning glaze chemistry (Stull map as a mental model)
- Glaze testers who need reproducible workflows (blend plans + exports + limits)

## Differentiators
- **Map-first exploration** (Stull as a first-class UI, not an afterthought)
- **Two-mode UX**: Basic for accessibility; Advanced for deep work
- **Deterministic “intelligence”**: guided adjustments with visible reasons (no magic)
- **Compatibility profiles**: match common calculators when needed (Glazy/Digitalfire)

## Proof points (copy-ready)
- “Every number has a trail.”
- “One recipe, many views.”
- “Make a change anywhere—see it everywhere.”

## Tone
- Calm, practical, respectful, non-salesy, pro-lab + friendly studio.
