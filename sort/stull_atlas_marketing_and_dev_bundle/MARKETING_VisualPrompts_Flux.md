# Visual Direction Prompts (Flux / Image Gen)

These are prompts for generating marketing visuals. Keep them **diagram-adjacent**, **clean**, and **lab-grade**—50/50 Digitalfire-ish + Glazy-ish + your own modern take.

## Prompt template
“Minimal, high-clarity UI marketing render for a ceramic glaze calculation app called ‘Stull Atlas’ …”

### 1) Hero UI mock (modern web)
A clean, functional app screenshot-style render: left library list, center stull map scatter plot, right inspect card with recipe name, cone, atmosphere, SiO2 and Al2O3 unity values; crisp typography, subtle shadows, high legibility, neutral background, no gimmicks, professional product photo lighting.

### 2) iPad bench scene (photoreal)
Photoreal iPad on a pottery studio workbench with a stull map view on screen, hands in frame, clay tools nearby, soft natural light, the UI looks real and readable, no brand confusion, high fidelity.

### 3) “One engine, many views” concept
Four small panels in a grid showing the same recipe in four instruments: modern web, Win95-style split panes, Mac 90s document+inspector, and a DOS terminal overlay; unified color accents, crisp.

### 4) DOS easter egg tease (subtle)
A tasteful marketing image of a modern UI with a faint “terminal overlay” hidden behind a key chord hint, CP437 box drawing, 80x25 grid, nostalgic but clean.

### 5) Mascot prompts (optional, understated)
If you choose a mascot, keep it technical and non-cute:
- Octopus: “engineering octopus” with subtle circuit-like suction cups, calm expression, monochrome line art.
- Spider: “precision spider” building a geometric web that looks like a network diagram, minimal line art.
