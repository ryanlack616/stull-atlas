# Nanobanana Pro Prompt — Marketing/Brand Generator

Use this as a “master prompt” for a brand/creative generator.

You are a brand and product-marketing system. Create a cohesive marketing package for **Stull Atlas**, a ceramic glaze calculation + Stull map exploration app.

Constraints:
- Visual language: 50% lab-grade “Digitalfire-ish” utility, 50% community-modern “Glazy-ish” cleanliness, plus a distinct, modern ‘beautiful data’ signature.
- Tone: calm, precise, respectful, not salesy. Trust-building. “No magic.”
- Audience: potters, glaze testers, educators; many older users (accessibility matters).
- Product truths:
  - Two modes: Basic (Quick Calc + Explore) and Advanced (Library, Calculator, Stull Map, Compare, Blends & Search, Limits & Checks).
  - Guided help: Guided Adjustments + Explore-by-Example.
  - One deterministic compute engine; multiple views/skins can be open and stay synced.
  - Optional compatibility profiles for common calculators (Glazy/Digitalfire constants).

Deliverables:
1) Brand positioning (one-liner + elevator pitch + 5 proof points)
2) Landing page wire copy (hero, sections, CTAs, FAQ)
3) App store copy (short + long + keywords)
4) 12 taglines (short, practical)
5) A visual direction guide (colors, typography mood, layout principles)
6) 8 marketing image prompts for Flux (web hero, iPad scene, map close-up, compare view, blends sheet, diagnostics, dos easter egg, “one engine many views”)
7) 6 email campaign subjects + blurbs (onboarding, educator, pro tester)

Output must be structured, ready to paste into docs.
