## Email 1: Derek Philip Au (Glazy)
**To:** derek@glazy.org
**Subject:** Stull Atlas — logo use request + thank you

Hi Derek,

I'm Ryan Lack — I built Stull Atlas (stullatlas.app), a glaze chemistry explorer
that's built entirely on top of Glazy's open data and your
ceramic-chemistry-visualization project. I'll be showing it at NCECA in Detroit
next month.

Two things:

1. **Thank you.** The entire dataset, the Stull region geometry, and the
   temperature contours all come from your work. I credit Glazy prominently on
   the About page with a description of what you've built and a link to
   glazy.org.

2. **Permission request.** I'd like to display the Glazy logo next to that
   credit block and on booth materials at NCECA. It would appear in an
   "acknowledgments" context — never implying endorsement or partnership,
   always with a link back to glazy.org. If you'd prefer I use a specific
   version of the mark, or if you'd rather I stick to text-only, I completely
   understand.

Happy to show you the app anytime — would love your feedback. And if you're at
NCECA, come by the booth.

Best,

## Email 2: Tony Hansen (Digitalfire)
**To:** (use contact form at digitalfire.com)
**Subject:** Stull Atlas — acknowledgment & logo use request

Hi Tony,

I'm Ryan Lack, a potter in Howell, Michigan. I've built a glaze chemistry tool
called Stull Atlas (stullatlas.app) that leans heavily on your Digitalfire
Reference Library — the materials database, oxide analysis data, and your
decades of educational articles have been foundational.

I credit Digitalfire on the About page with a description of your contributions
and a link to digitalfire.com. I'll be presenting at NCECA in Detroit
(March 25–27) and would like to ask:

Would you be comfortable with me displaying the Digitalfire logo alongside that
acknowledgment, both in the app and on printed booth materials? It would be
purely attributive — "Built on data from Digitalfire" — never implying
endorsement. If you have brand guidelines or a preferred logo file, I'd be
happy to use those.

Your library is one of the most important resources in ceramics. Thank you for
making it available.

Best regards,
Ryan Lack
