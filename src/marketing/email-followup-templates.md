## Email 1: General Follow-up (to everyone who signed up)

**Subject**: Thanks for stopping by — your Stull Atlas Pro access is live

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for checking out Stull Atlas at NCECA — it was great talking glaze 
chemistry with you in Detroit.

Your free Pro access is active through April. Here's what you can do with it:

• Explorer — 9,000+ glazes on interactive Stull charts
  stullatlas.app

• Blend Calculators — line, triaxial, biaxial, quadaxial, radial, space-filling
  stullatlas.app/#/calc

• Recipe Optimizer — set UMF targets, get material recipes
  stullatlas.app/#/calc/optimizer

• AI Suggestions — describe what you want, get a recipe
  stullatlas.app/#/suggest

If you did the $29/3-month Pro deal at the booth, that's already applied to 
your account — no action needed.

Quick question: What feature would make Stull Atlas indispensable for your 
studio work? Hit reply — I read everything.

Happy firing,

## Email 2: For people who were especially engaged / had good conversations

**Subject**: Following up from NCECA — [specific thing you talked about]

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I really enjoyed our conversation at NCECA about [specific topic — e.g., 
"your shino recipe experiments" / "the crazing problem on that porcelain 
body" / "using triaxials to find the right flux balance"].

I wanted to follow up with a couple things:

1. Your Pro access is live through April — all the blend calculators, 
   optimizer, and AI suggestions are unlocked.

2. [Specific helpful thing — e.g., "I ran your recipe through the UMF 
   calculator and the Si:Al ratio is 8.2:1 — that's solidly in Stull's 
   bright zone. If you want to push it toward satin, you'd want to bring 
   that down to around 6:1 by adding alumina."]

If you have questions about any of the tools, or want to talk through a 
glaze problem, just reply here. I'm always up for glaze talk.

Best,
Ryan

## Email 3: 2-week follow-up (to people who haven't logged in)

**Subject**: Your Stull Atlas access expires in 2 weeks — have you tried the AI suggest?

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Quick note — your free Pro access from NCECA expires at the end of April.

If you haven't had a chance to explore yet, here's the fastest way to see 
what it does:

1. Go to stullatlas.app/#/suggest
2. Type what you're looking for — like "satin celadon cone 6" or 
   "glossy amber no barium"
3. Get an optimized recipe with full UMF and materials list

Takes about 30 seconds. People at the booth said this was their favorite 
feature.

The explorer (stullatlas.app) is always free — no account needed. But the 
AI suggestions, optimizer, and blend calculators are Pro. If you'd like 
to keep them after April, plans start at $9/month.

Best,
Ryan

## Email 4: End of free period (late April)
