## POST 1 — Launch / Introduction
**Image**: Screenshot of the 2D explorer with ~3,000 dots, a glaze selected, detail panel open.

**Caption**:
```
In 1912, Ray T. Stull mapped glaze chemistry onto a two-axis chart — SiO₂ vs Al₂O₃ — and showed that surface quality could be predicted from oxide ratios.

114 years later, we put 9,000+ real glazes on that same chart.

Stull Atlas is a glaze chemistry explorer I've been building for the studio. Every dot is a recipe someone mixed, fired, and documented. Click it and you get the full recipe, UMF breakdown, and the 5 most similar glazes ranked by oxide distance.

The explorer and UMF calculator are free. Link in bio.

## POST 2 — Then vs. Now
**Image**: Side-by-side: Stull's 1912 chart (from the About page) next to your explorer.

**Caption**:
```
Left: Chart 1 from Transactions of the American Ceramic Society, Vol. XIV, 1912.

Right: The same coordinate system, 9,000 glazes later.

Stull mapped test glazes by their silica-to-alumina ratio and identified the regions that predict surface quality — matte, bright, crazed, underfired. His framework still holds.

We just added a few thousand data points and some interactive features.

## POST 3 — Triaxial Blend
**Image**: Screenshot of the triaxial blend calculator with 3 recipes and colored grid.

**Caption**:
```
Plan before you mix.

Triaxial blends are one of the best ways to explore glaze space systematically — three recipes at the corners, every blend point calculated for you.

In Stull Atlas you pick your 3 glazes, set the number of divisions, and get:
✓ Full recipes for every blend point
✓ UMF values for each
✓ Overlay on the Stull chart
✓ CSV export for your studio notebook

Line, biaxial, quadaxial, radial, and space-filling blends too.

## POST 4 — AI Suggest (The Hook)
**Image/Reel**: Screen recording — type "matte celadon cone 6" → watch the result appear. 15-30 seconds.

**Caption**:
```
"Matte celadon, cone 6."

That's it. Type what you want, get an optimized recipe.

The AI suggestion engine in Stull Atlas takes a plain-English description and returns a recipe with full UMF, materials list, and where it lands on the Stull chart.

It's not magic — it's constraint optimization with natural language on top. But it feels like magic when you're standing in the glaze room wondering what to try next.

## POST 5 — 3D Explorer
**Image**: Screenshot of the 3D Stull chart with a dramatic angle, colored by cone.

**Caption**:
```
Add a third dimension.

The 3D explorer maps glazes by SiO₂, Al₂O₃, and any third variable — cone temperature, flux ratio, boron content, or individual oxides.

Rotate it, zoom in, click any point. Same data, new perspective.

## POST 6 — Optimizer
**Image**: Screenshot of optimizer with target values set and a converged result.

**Caption**:
```
Set your targets. Let math do the mixing.

The recipe optimizer takes your target UMF values — say SiO₂ 3.5, Al₂O₃ 0.35, CaO 0.5 — and finds material combinations that hit them.

Two modes:
• Gradient descent — fast, precise, finds the nearest solution
• Genetic algorithm — explores more broadly, finds creative recipes you might not have tried

Both export full recipes you can take straight to the studio.

## POST 7 — NCECA Announcement

We're coming to NCECA 2026.

Detroit. March 25-27. Resource Hall.

Stull Atlas is a computational glaze chemistry explorer — 9,000+ glazes on interactive Stull charts, blend calculators, a recipe optimizer, and an AI suggestion engine.

Come see it live. Play with it. Ask hard questions about glaze chemistry. I'll be there all three days.

🎁 NCECA deal: $29 for 3 months of Pro (46% off).

## POST 8 — "Built by a Potter"
**Image**: Photo of your studio OR a mug glazed with a recipe from the app.

**Caption**:
```
This isn't a tech company product. It's a tool I built because I needed it.

I'm a potter in Howell, Michigan. I mix from raw materials. I read Digitalfire articles at midnight. I've stared at Stull charts wondering what's in the gap between that tenmoku and that celadon.

So I built Stull Atlas — a way to see all of it at once. 9,000+ glazes mapped, searchable, analyzable. Blend calculators that do the math before I weigh anything. An AI that takes "satin white cone 6, no zinc" and gives me a starting recipe.

The dataset comes from Glazy (thank you, Derek Au). The materials knowledge from Digitalfire (thank you, Tony Hansen). I just built a new lens.

Free to explore. Link in bio.
