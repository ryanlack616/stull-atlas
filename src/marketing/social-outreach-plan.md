# Stull Atlas — NCECA 2026 Social & Outreach Plan
## 6 Weeks Out (Feb 10 → March 25)

---

## Where Potters Hang Out Online

### Tier 1 — High-impact, go first
| Platform | Community | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Instagram** | #ceramics #pottery #glazechemistry #stoneware #cone6 #pottersofinstagram | Visual-first. Show the app, not words. Reels perform 3-5x better than static posts. |
| **Instagram** | #NCECA #NCECA2026 #NCECADetroit #ComeClayWithUs | Conference-specific. Start using ~3 weeks before event. |
| **Facebook Groups** | "Critical Craft Forum" (16k+), "Ceramic Arts Daily Community", "Glaze Chemistry for Potters", "Cone 6 Potters" | These groups allow tool announcements if you're genuine about it. Don't spam — share value. |
| **Glazy community** | glazy.org posts/comments | You literally built on their data. Post about it there. Derek's community will be curious. |

### Tier 2 — Worth doing, lower lift
| Platform | Community | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Reddit** | r/pottery (50k+), r/ceramics (25k+), r/glazing | Redditors hate marketing but love tools. Frame as "I built this free thing, feedback wanted." |
| **Clayart listserv** | clayart@lsv.ceramics.org | Old-school email list. Still active. Tony Hansen posts there. Respect the tone — it's technical and professional. |
| **YouTube** | Pottery/ceramics niche | 2-3 minute demo video showing the explorer + a blend calculation. Evergreen content. |

### Tier 3 — Long-tail / post-NCECA
| Platform | Community | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Ceramics Monthly** | ceramicsmonthly.org | Digital advertising or editorial pitch. "New Tool for Glaze Chemistry" angle. |
| **Ceramic Arts Network** | ceramicartsnetwork.org | CAD forums, possibly a webinar slot |
| **NCECA Journal / Blog** | nceca.net | Post-conference recap blog post about your experience |
| **Threads** | @myclaycorner or @stullatlas | Lower priority but easy cross-post from Instagram |

## Content That Works for This Audience

### What resonates
- **Before/after: Stull 1912 → your explorer** — potters love history
- **Real recipes on screen** — show the data, not marketing speak
- **"I built this" authenticity** — solo potter building tools, not some tech company
- **Video of the AI suggest** — "type what you want, get a recipe" is a jaw-dropper for potters
- **The Stull chart explained** — educational content that happens to show your tool
- **"Free to explore"** — remove the barrier, let curiosity pull them in

### What doesn't
- Feature lists without context
- Corporate marketing tone
- Posting the same thing in 5 groups
- Comparing yourself to Glazy or Insight (you complement them, you don't replace them)

## Messaging Framework

### One-Liner
> Stull Atlas — A computational glaze chemistry explorer, 114 years after Stull.

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
> Stull Atlas maps 3,200+ real glaze recipes on interactive Stull charts. You can 
> filter by cone, surface, and color — click any point to see the full recipe and 
> UMF. It also has blend calculators, a recipe optimizer, and an AI engine that 
> takes plain-English descriptions like "satin celadon, cone 6" and gives you 
> optimized recipes. The explorer and UMF calculator are always free.

### NCECA Booth Pitch (10 seconds)
> "It's like Google Maps for glaze chemistry — 3,000+ real glazes mapped on a 
> Stull chart. Try it free, scan the QR code."

### For Facebook Groups / Reddit
> Hey all — I'm a potter in Howell, MI and I've been building a glaze chemistry 
> tool called Stull Atlas. It plots 3,200+ Glazy recipes on interactive Stull 
> charts and has blend calculators, a UMF calculator, and an AI suggestion engine. 
> The dataset comes from Glazy (credited prominently — huge thanks to Derek Au) 
> and the materials data from Digitalfire.
>
> The explorer and core tools are free. I'd love feedback from people who actually 
> use glaze chemistry daily — what's useful, what's missing, what would make you 
> come back.
