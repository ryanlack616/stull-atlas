Though not utilitarian vessels, they demonstrate intentional pyrotechnology — the controlled use of fire to irreversibly transform a plastic material (clay) into a rigid ceramic body through sintering.

    descriptionDetailed: 'Jōmon-period ceramics (c. 16,500–3,000 BP) are among the earliest known functional pottery vessels worldwide. The characteristic cord-marked (jōmon) surfaces were created by impressing twisted plant fibers into wet clay. Crucially, Jōmon pottery predates the adoption of agriculture in the Japanese archipelago, challenging the model that ceramic technology emerges only in sedentary agricultural communities.',

    descriptionDetailed: 'Archaeological evidence from Çatalhöyük and surrounding Anatolian sites reveals purpose-built firing structures dating to approximately 7000 BCE. These proto-kilns represent a critical technological transition from open-fire to enclosed-fire ceramics, enabling higher, more uniform temperatures and controlled atmospheres (oxidation vs. reduction).

Three manufacturing methods have been identified: application, efflorescence, and cementation — each exploiting different mechanisms of surface-glass formation.

    descriptionSimple: 'People in the Middle East discovered that certain rocks containing lead could melt at low temperatures and make a shiny, glass-like coating on pottery. This trick was used for over 3,000 years.',
    descriptionDetailed: 'Lead-oxide glazes (PbO-SiO₂ system) emerged circa 1500 BCE. Lead oxide\'s exceptionally low eutectic temperature (~510°C in the PbO-SiO₂ binary) and powerful fluxing action made it the dominant low-fire glaze flux for over three millennia. Lead glazes produce brilliant, transparent surfaces with high refractive index.

    descriptionDetailed: 'Attic black-figure and red-figure wares demonstrate sophisticated atmospheric control through a three-phase firing cycle: oxidation (Fe₂O₃, red), reduction (Fe₃O₄/FeO, black), and selective re-oxidation. The refined slip (illite clay, <1 μm particle size) sinters to impermeability during reduction, preventing re-oxidation, while the coarser body re-oxidizes to red.

Produced at multiple sites across the Roman Empire (Arezzo, La Graufesenque, Rheinzabern), the characteristic red-gloss surface was achieved through a refined iron-bearing illite slip fired in oxidation at ~1050°C.

The characteristic green-blue color results from iron oxide (1–3% Fe₂O₃) reduced to Fe²⁺ in a CO-rich kiln atmosphere.

    descriptionDetailed: 'Abbasid luster ware (Iraq, 9th century CE) employs post-firing reduction of metallic compounds (Ag₂O, CuO) painted onto a tin-opacified lead glaze. During a low-temperature (~600°C) reduction firing, metal ions migrate to the surface and aggregate into metallic nanoparticles (5–50 nm), producing interference colors and metallic reflectance.

Though many earlier texts are lost, their existence is referenced in later compilations such as Abu\'l-Qasim\'s treatise (1301).

Ru ware achieves a specific iron-in-reduction color through precise control of atmosphere, temperature (~1200°C), and iron content (1–2% Fe₂O₃). Jun ware\'s opalescent blue results from colloidal phase separation (liquid-liquid immiscibility) in a high-silica calcium glaze — a phenomenon not scientifically explained until the 20th century.

The Korean innovation of sanggam (inlaid celadon) — incising designs into leather-hard porcelain stoneware, filling intaglio channels with white or black slip, then applying the celadon glaze — is technically distinct from any Chinese technique.

Cobalt\'s unique stability across a wide firing range (remaining blue from ~1000°C to >1350°C in both oxidation and reduction) and strong tinctorial strength make it the ideal ceramic colorant.
